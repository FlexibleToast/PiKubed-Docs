# Pi Kubed Docs

## What is this?

This is just a simple place holder site that I can quickly update using Markdown thanks to [strapdownjs](strapdownjs.com). I'll use this to quickly make notes about my PiKubed project where I plan to use Raspberry Pi 4s to create a Kubernetes cluster for learning purposes. Later I plan to replace this simple site with a more appropriate blog style site probably using something along the lines of WordPress. The site is hosted at [pikubed.com](http://pikubed.com).
