# Pi Kubed Docs

## What is this?

This is just a simple place holder site that I can quickly update using Markdown thanks to [strapdownjs](http://strapdownjs.com). I'll use this to quickly make notes about my PiKubed project where I plan to use Raspberry Pi 4s to create a Kubernetes cluster for learning purposes. Later I plan to replace this simple site with a more appropriate blog style site probably using something along the lines of WordPress.

## The plan

I have ditched most of my original plans as I have read up and learned about different technologies. I now want to make a Kubernetes cluter using 4 Raspberry Pi 4s, using [k3s](https://k3s.io/), with [Rook CEPH](https://rook.io/) storage. K3s is a lightweight, compliant version of Kubernetes that doesn't rely on Docker and instead uses the containerd daemon directly. Rook is a Kubernetes native way of handling stateful storage. The Rook CEPH implementation has been released as stable and is what Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform uses for its stateful storage in version 4+.

## Current status

- Installed the latest version of [Raspbian Buster Lite](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/)

- Created DHCP reservations for each Pi (can alternatively use static IPs outside of your DHCP range)

- Performed `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade` to make sure packages are at latest version

- Updated passwords, changed hostnames, set GPU memory split to 16mb, changed timezones

- Added a user for Ansible `sudo adduser ansible && sudo usermod -aG sudo ansible`, this creates the ansible user and adds it to the sudo group

- Distributed ssh keys to both pi and ansible users
  
  ```bash
  ssh-copy-id pi@pikubed0
  ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/ansible ansible@pikubed0
  ```

- Added the Pis to my `/etc/ansible/inventory`
  
  ```yaml
  [pikubed_cluster:children]
  master
  workers

  [master]
  pikubed0  vip_priority=110

  [workers]
  pikubed1  vip_priority=109
  pikubed2
  pikubed3
  ```

- And tested connectivity with `ansible pikubed_cluster -m ping`

- Started creating ansible playbooks

- Created ansible role to install and configure log2ram

- Created ansible role to install k3s on master and nodes

- Created configure.yml ansible playbook
  
  - Updates packages to latest
  
  - Installs log2ram
  
  - Moves /tmp to tmpfs
  
  - Creates a /etc/hosts for each node that includes each node
  
  - Installs K3S

- Created reboot.yml playbook that reboots each node in the cluster in series

- Created upgrade.yml playbook that upgrades k3s on the nodes

## Todo

- Learn how to use Traefik for ingress

- Test deployments (move this site to be hosted on the cluster)

- Install rook-ceph

## Tempratures

All Raspberry Pi 4s are installed in a 4 node [C4Labs Bramble Case](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07VMHFZZJ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1). Which was a pain to put together because the instructions have you balancing all the nuts and side pieces together like a house of cards. After it all collapsed I decided to rebuild and this time go ahead and put the screws in some of those nuts. They held it together loosely, but they at least held together until I could get other structural componants in place, then had to back out and re-screw the parts... The case comes with heatsinks and 2 fans (3 fans if you get the 6 node case). I placed the heatspreaders on the chips and out of curiosity I left the fans unplugged to measure temperature. After 1 hour of idle the node temps were and average of 85c.

| Node     | Temp |
| -------- | ---- |
| pikubed0 | 89c  |
| pikubed1 | 91c  |
| pikubed2 | 88c  |
| pikubed3 | 73c  |

The room had an ambient temperature of 73f. Each node was too hot to handle and from what I can see online 85c is the max temperature the Pi should run at. Running at the max temp while idle even before Kuberenetes is installed isn't acceptable. With fans plugged in I measured the temperature after an hour at idle again. This time the average was 31c. The noise of the fans are a little annoying, but the difference in temperature is pretty staggering

| Node     | Temp |
| -------- | ---- |
| pikubed0 | 32c  |
| pikubed1 | 31c  |
| pikubed2 | 30c  |
| pikubed3 | 31c  |

## Keepalived

Using Traefik for ingress means that traffic that goes to any node gets routed to the correct node. Therefore for high availability I decided to create a virtual IP that points to two nodes in the cluster. This way any incoming traffic can be routed to the VIP (such as port forwarding from the router) and even if one of the nodes is down, services should still be working. In this cluster arrangement it should be able to suffer 1 node failure, this removes a single point of failure.
