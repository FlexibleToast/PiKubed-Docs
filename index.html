# Pi Kubed Docs

## What is this?

This is just a simple place holder site that I can quickly update using Markdown thanks to strapdownjs. I'll use this to quickly make notes about my PiKubed project where I plan to use Raspberry Pi 4s to create a Kubernetes cluster for learning purposes. Later I plan to replace this simple site with a more appropriate blog style site probably using something along the lines of WordPress.

## The plan

I want to use 4 Raspberry Pi 4s to create a Kubernetes cluster with GlusterFS initially and perhaps CEPH later. I plan to use Ansible and create different roles to accomplish the different Day 1 and Day 2 tasks needed to deploy and manage the cluster. I figured this would be a good way to learn the intricacies of each of these technologies.
