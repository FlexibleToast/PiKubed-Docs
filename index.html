# Pi Kubed Docs

## What is this?

This is just a simple place holder site that I can quickly update using Markdown thanks to [strapdownjs](http://strapdownjs.com). I'll use this to quickly make notes about my PiKubed project where I plan to use Raspberry Pi 4s to create a Kubernetes cluster for learning purposes. Later I plan to replace this simple site with a more appropriate blog style site probably using something along the lines of WordPress.

## The plan

I have ditched most of my original plans as I have read up and learned about different technologies. I now want to make a Kubernetes cluter using 4 Raspberry Pi 4s, using [k3s](https://k3s.io/), with [Kadalu](https://kadalu.io) storage. K3s is a lightweight, compliant version of Kubernetes that doesn't rely on Docker and instead uses the containerd daemon directly. Kadalu provides an operator for provisioning PVs using GlusterFS backing.

## Current status

- Installed [Ubuntu 20.04](https://ubuntu.com/download/raspberry-pi)

- Created an Ansible playbook that uses several different roles to:
  - Update each host
  - Install required packages
  - Update root password and distribute ssh-key
  - Change hostname of machines to match inventory names
  - Create /etc/hosts including all node members
  - Move the /tmp directory to tmpfs
  - Install log2ram
  - Install keepalived for virtual IP
  - Encrypt external drives with LUKS and mounting to a specified mountpoint using their UUID to later be used by kadalu
  - Install k3s using their embedded etcd for high availability

## Inventory file

The created playbook requires an inventory file consisting of two groups called masters and workers. In the inventory file you can specify the vip_priority in order to add the host to the keepalived virtual IP. Below is my inventory file as an example.

  ```yaml
  all:
  children:
    pikubed_cluster:
      children:
        masters:
          hosts:
            pikubed-m0:
              ansible_host: pikubed-m0.lan
              vip_priority: 110
              drives:
              - name: 128usb
                device: sda
                partition: 1
                fstype: f2fs
                mount: /kadalu
            pikubed-m1:
              ansible_host: pikubed-m1.lan
              vip_priority: 109
              drives:
              - name: 128usb
                device: sda
                partition: 1
                fstype: f2fs
                mount: /kadalu
            pikubed-m2:
              ansible_host: pikubed-m2.lan
              vip_priority: 108
              drives:
              - name: 128usb
                device: sda
                partition: 1
                fstype: f2fs
                mount: /kadalu
        workers:
          hosts:
            pikubed-w0:
              ansible_host: pikubed-w0.lan
              drives:
              - name: 128usb
                device: sda
                partition: 1
                fstype: f2fs
                mount: /kadalu
  ```

## Notes about temperatures

All Raspberry Pi 4s are installed in a 4 node [C4Labs Bramble Case](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07VMHFZZJ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1). Which was a pain to put together because the instructions have you balancing all the nuts and side pieces together like a house of cards. After it all collapsed I decided to rebuild and this time go ahead and put the screws in some of those nuts. They held it together loosely, but they at least held together until I could get other structural components in place, then had to back out and re-screw the parts... The case comes with heatspreaders and 2 fans (3 fans if you get the 6 node case). I placed the heatspreaders on the chips and out of curiosity I left the fans unplugged to measure temperature. After 1 hour of idle the node temps were and average of 85c.

| Node     | Temp |
| -------- | ---- |
| pikubed0 | 89c  |
| pikubed1 | 91c  |
| pikubed2 | 88c  |
| pikubed3 | 73c  |

The room had an ambient temperature of 73f. Each node was too hot to handle and from what I can see online 85c is the max temperature the Pi should run at. Running at the max temp while idle even before Kubernetes is installed isn't acceptable. With fans plugged in I measured the temperature after an hour at idle again. This time the average was 31c. The noise of the fans are a little annoying, but the difference in temperature is pretty staggering

| Node     | Temp |
| -------- | ---- |
| pikubed0 | 32c  |
| pikubed1 | 31c  |
| pikubed2 | 30c  |
| pikubed3 | 31c  |

## Keepalived

Using Traefik for ingress means that traffic that goes to any node gets routed to the correct node. Therefore for high availability I decided to create a virtual IP that points to the master nodes in the cluster. This way any incoming traffic can be routed to the VIP (such as port forwarding from the router) and even if one of the nodes is down, services should still be working. In this cluster arrangement it should be able to suffer 1 node failure, this removes a single point of failure.
