# Pi Kubed Docs

## What is this?

This is just a simple place holder site that I can quickly update using Markdown thanks to [strapdownjs](http://strapdownjs.com). I'll use this to quickly make notes about my PiKubed project where I plan to use Raspberry Pi 4s to create a Kubernetes cluster for learning purposes. Later I plan to replace this simple site with a more appropriate blog style site probably using something along the lines of WordPress.

## The plan

I have ditched most of my original plans as I have read up and learned about different technologies. I now want to make a Kubernetes cluter using 4 Raspberry Pi 4s, using [k3s](https://k3s.io/), with [Heketi gluster-kubernetes](https://github.com/gluster/gluster-kubernetes) storage. K3s is a lightweight, compliant version of Kubernetes that doesn't rely on Docker and instead uses the containerd daemon directly. Heketi provides a rest API to provision GlusterFS volumes and is used by OpenShift 3.X to provide persistent storage.

## Current status

- Installed the latest version of [Raspbian Buster Lite](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/)

- Created an Ansible playbook that uses several different roles to:
  - Update each host
  - Install required packages
  - Expand root filesystem
  - Update root password and distribute ssh-key
  - Create ansible user and distribute ssh-key
  - Change hostname of machines to match inventory names
  - Create /etc/hosts including all node members
  - Move the /tmp directory to tmpfs
  - Install log2ram
  - Distribute ssh keys (Only needed if using k3sup method that is currently not working since I've coded it to use the embedded HA that does not work in k3s at this time)
  - Install keepalived for virtual IP
  - Install Galera (highly available MariaDB used for install-k3s-ha role creating an "external datastore")
  - Install k3s on all nodes

## Inventory file

The created playbook requires an inventory file consisting of two groups called masters and workers. In the inventory file you can specify the vip_priority in order to add the host to the keepalived virtual IP. Below is my inventory file as an example.

  ```yaml
  [pikubed_cluster:children]
  masters
  workers

  [pikubed_cluster:vars]
  ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3 # This is used because Debian defualts to python2 still

  [masters]
  pikubed-m0  vip_priority=110
  pikubed-m1  vip_priority=109
  pikubed-m1  vip_priority=108

  [workers]
  pikubed-w0
  ```

## The vars.yml.template

I've provided a template file called `vars.yml.template` that is used to specify the variables for your environment.

### Changes to come

I plan to update the vars.yml file so that along with the inventory file they're the only two things that will need to be changed for your environment. Moving things like the option to choose default install or highly available install to the vars.yml file instead of modifying code.

## Todo

The next major change will be to add a role that installs Heketi to be ready to used in a deployment.

After that, I plan to template some basic deployments like cert-manager for use with [Traefik](https://containo.us/traefik/) and [Letsencrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/). Probably providing a sample hello-world deployment to showcase how traefik is used in a deployment with tls certificates.

## Notes about temperatures

All Raspberry Pi 4s are installed in a 4 node [C4Labs Bramble Case](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07VMHFZZJ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1). Which was a pain to put together because the instructions have you balancing all the nuts and side pieces together like a house of cards. After it all collapsed I decided to rebuild and this time go ahead and put the screws in some of those nuts. They held it together loosely, but they at least held together until I could get other structural components in place, then had to back out and re-screw the parts... The case comes with heatspreaders and 2 fans (3 fans if you get the 6 node case). I placed the heatspreaders on the chips and out of curiosity I left the fans unplugged to measure temperature. After 1 hour of idle the node temps were and average of 85c.

| Node     | Temp |
| -------- | ---- |
| pikubed0 | 89c  |
| pikubed1 | 91c  |
| pikubed2 | 88c  |
| pikubed3 | 73c  |

The room had an ambient temperature of 73f. Each node was too hot to handle and from what I can see online 85c is the max temperature the Pi should run at. Running at the max temp while idle even before Kubernetes is installed isn't acceptable. With fans plugged in I measured the temperature after an hour at idle again. This time the average was 31c. The noise of the fans are a little annoying, but the difference in temperature is pretty staggering

| Node     | Temp |
| -------- | ---- |
| pikubed0 | 32c  |
| pikubed1 | 31c  |
| pikubed2 | 30c  |
| pikubed3 | 31c  |

## Keepalived

Using Traefik for ingress means that traffic that goes to any node gets routed to the correct node. Therefore for high availability I decided to create a virtual IP that points to two nodes in the cluster. This way any incoming traffic can be routed to the VIP (such as port forwarding from the router) and even if one of the nodes is down, services should still be working. In this cluster arrangement it should be able to suffer 1 node failure, this removes a single point of failure.
